# Numerical Cycle Analysis

## Description:
Numerical Cycle Analysis is a cutting-edge tool designed to identify and predict cyclical patterns in data using advanced mathematical and computational methods. The tool utilizes algorithms based on **contribution analysis** and **perturbation analysis** to uncover complex patterns within large datasets, commonly applied in areas such as **economics**, **sociology**, **engineering**, and **finance**.

This code leverages numerical methods to analyze and forecast business cycles, market trends, solar cycles, and mechanical behaviors under stress. It allows for dynamic, real-time forecasting and offers a significant improvement over traditional econometric models, which may struggle with rapidly changing conditions.

### Key Features:
- **Economic Cycle Prediction**: Forecasts economic fluctuations, market trends, and business cycles using real-time data.
- **Mechanical Behavior Modeling**: Uses **Finite Element Methods (FEM)** to predict mechanical stress and strain in engineering applications.
- **Versatile**: Can be applied across various domains, including economics, sociology, and environmental sciences.
- **Customizable**: Users can tweak parameters for specific datasets or scenarios.

### Applications:
- **Economic Forecasting**: Enhance fiscal policy decisions, understand market movements, and predict future recessions or expansions.
- **Solar Cycles**: Aid in forecasting solar activities like sunspots, which affect satellite and communication systems.
- **Mechanical Stress Testing**: Useful in engineering to simulate mechanical behaviors under various conditions.

## How to Use:
1. Install required dependencies using:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2. Run the main script:
    ```bash
    python main_code.py
    ```
3. Modify the parameters in `main_code.py` to suit your data or specific requirements.

## Data:
- The code requires external data files such as `economic_data.csv` and `new_economic_data.csv`. These files are essential for the analysis, and users are expected to provide their own datasets.
- The data should include relevant economic or other cyclical data for accurate analysis.

**Note**: You can find various sources for economic datasets or use your own custom data for testing.
