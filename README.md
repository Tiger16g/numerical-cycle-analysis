Numerical Cycle Analysis
Description:
Numerical Cycle Analysis is a cutting-edge tool designed to identify and predict cyclical patterns in data using advanced mathematical and computational methods. The tool utilizes algorithms based on contribution analysis and perturbation analysis to uncover complex patterns within large datasets, commonly applied in areas such as economics, sociology, engineering, and finance.

This code leverages numerical methods to analyze and forecast business cycles, market trends, solar cycles, and mechanical behaviors under stress. It allows for dynamic, real-time forecasting and offers a significant improvement over traditional econometric models, which may struggle with rapidly changing conditions.

Key Features:
Economic Cycle Prediction: Forecasts economic fluctuations, market trends, and business cycles using real-time data.
Mechanical Behavior Modeling: Uses Finite Element Methods (FEM) to predict mechanical stress and strain in engineering applications.
Large Dataset Support: Utilizes Dask for handling large datasets, with a fallback to Pandas for smaller datasets.
Customizable: Users can tweak parameters like learning rate and maximum depth for XGBoost based on specific datasets or scenarios.
Interactive Visualization: Built-in Plotly integration for real-time, interactive data visualizations of predictions.
Applications:
Economic Forecasting: Enhance fiscal policy decisions, understand market movements, and predict future recessions or expansions.
Solar Cycles: Aid in forecasting solar activities like sunspots, which affect satellite and communication systems.
Mechanical Stress Testing: Useful in engineering to simulate mechanical behaviors under various conditions.
